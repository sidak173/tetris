# Tetris
ï»¿Introduction:

A simple Tetris game created using html,CSS(with a little bit of bootstrap) and Vanilla javascript. The object of the game is to score as many points by making horizontal rows of boxes. The game ends when the tetriminos stack to the top.

Features:

- Rows of filled boxes once formed, disappear and any blocks above it fall down to fill the space. Each row leads to 10 points being awarded to the player.
- There are 5 types of tetriminos and all of them fall randomly from the top.
- The game also contains levels. As score increases and reaches a given threshold, the level rises too and difficulty increases. This is achieved by making the speed at which tetriminos fall faster. This is achieved by using setInterval() functionality in javascript DOM.
- The user could also move the tetriminos left and right as they fall using the left and right keys on the keyboard. He could also rotate the tetriminos using the up key.
- Styling is done through CSS and bootstrap. The application also makes use of google fonts.
